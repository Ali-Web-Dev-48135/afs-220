#Intro
This was a really fun project I've been working on now.
I always wanted to clone a gamestop website. 
I was inspired by my own love for video games and the stories told behind the screens and small tiny chips in our consoles.
The React.Js project is a fairly simple project, but still complex using Redux for state management and custom hooks.
This is only a front-end application, the full project is still not deployed and I only worked on it as practice using ASP.NET Core for the backend.

#Running the app on your local machine.
